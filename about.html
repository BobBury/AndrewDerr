                <h2>My Background</h2>
                <p>
                    I grew up in Northern California in a city called El Dorado Hills. 
                    For as long as I could remember I have had a keen interest in technology. Following each tech release and always wanted to get the product with the newest feature. 
                    I guess you could say I was always intrigued by innovation. Not only did I have a strong interest for technology, but also a love for problem solving. 
                    As a young kid, I was obsessed with lego sets. When I would get a new set, I would work tirelessly until it was complete. Often times my parents would literally have to tear me away from my project for me to eat a meal or go to soccer practice. 
                    This love for technology and problem solving has stuck with me ever since. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through middle school I enjoyed messing with remote control planes, drones and cars. One project that I remember taking on during middle school was a hat that consisted of an RC place fan and a 9-volt battery. I attached this contraption to the bill of a hat, facing towards the hat wearer, and used it to cool myself down during the hottest summer days. 
                    In high school, I took on assembling my own desktop computer. I set out the parts that I wanted and asked for them for Christmas. On Christmas day, I opened all the parts and assembled it within about an hour. 
                    The methodic way of piecing everything together and watching the computer boot up for the first time was so revolutionary to me. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This feeling was hard to find through many other activities, but after deciding on a whim to take a java programming class in junior year of highschool, I found the feeling again. 
                    To learn the syntax, think through a complex problem, program a solution and see it work was that feeling all over again. 
                    I realized that this was the thing that I enjoyed doing and through it I could benefit the lives of people all over the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So when I took off for college in Colorado, entering the computer science major was a no-brainer. 
                    Ever since entering the major, I have loved learning various coding languages and enjoyed teaching other students those same languages. 
                    This past year has been amazing as I have been able to extend my love for programming to the students in the lab classes that I teach.
